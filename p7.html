        <i>Dandelion</i> is a relaxing, meditative game. You are a dandelion floating in the gentle breeze. You will meet other dendelions flying, all show its swagger, but end up drifting off in the wind. 
        <br>There is no win or lose, no rules, no objects in this game. It is more of an art piece, a poem, a journey. It is a safe space for you to escape from daily work and stress, even just for a little while.

        Reflection

      <p>
        Two years ago, when I was traveling alone in Florence, Italy, I stood on an old bridge watching people stream across it. Suddenly I had the feeling that I was seeing the world passÂ by all around me. That feeling of being fully detached from the 
        rest of the world reminds me of dandelions. They scatter in the sky and sway in the gentle breeze, unsure of where they should go. Once they've settle down, they will grasp that chance to reproduce, and wait for the wind to take them on another adventure. 
        Now, as an international student alone in a strange city, I can relate even more to that feeling. I feel like a dandelion, flying into a new place and attempting to connect with new people, new city, and new memories.

        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by my own experience, as I've mentioned above. While designing the game, I started with doing rough sketches and storyboard. My intention for this game is to express my feelings and thoughts. So I didn't set an object for this game. I hope it is less conpetitive
        , relaxing, Zen, and hopefully inspiring. 
        <div class="fullwidth">
          <img style="width:800px; object-fit: scale-down;" src="https://cdn.glitch.me/213fc27b-b238-4573-8d3f-2b3f35a789bd%2FIMG_0381.jpg?v=1636409182852"></div>
        <br>
        Then, I made refined sketches to explore the visual design, and transfered it into p5 sketch. 
        <div class="fullwidth">
          <img style="width:800px; object-fit: scale-down;" src="https://cdn.glitch.me/213fc27b-b238-4573-8d3f-2b3f35a789bd%2FIMG_0383.png?v=1636409190217"></div>
        <br>
        After I finish the p5 sketch. I invited my friends to test play the game. They were confused about how to control the movements. So I added a tutorial prior to the game.
